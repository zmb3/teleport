These guides show you how to run a Teleport cluster in production.

## Deploy on Kubernetes using Helm 

You can deploy a complete, high-availability Teleport cluster on Kubernetes
using our `teleport-cluster` Helm chart. These guides show you how to deploy the
`teleport-cluster` Helm chart on your cloud:

- [Google Cloud](./helm-deployments/gcp.mdx)
- [AWS](./helm-deployments/aws.mdx)
- [Kubernetes with SSO](./helm-deployments/kubernetes-cluster.mdx)
- [Custom Kubernetes Deployment](./helm-deployments/custom.mdx)
- [Migrating from our Legacy Helm Charts](./helm-deployments/migration.mdx)

## Deploy using virtual machines

You can run a production cluster of Teleport instances using virtual machines.
In these guides, we will show you how to deploy a high-availability, VM-based
Teleport cluster on your cloud:

- [AWS with Terraform](./deployments/aws-terraform.mdx)
- [Google Cloud](./deployments/gcp.mdx)
- [IBM Cloud](./deployments/ibm.mdx)
