This tutorial will guide you through the steps needed to install and run
Teleport (=teleport.version=) on a Linux machine, then show you how to use
Teleport to configure access to resources.

We will run the following Teleport services:

- **Teleport Auth Service:** The certificate authority for your cluster. It
  issues certificates and conducts authentication challenges. The Auth Service
  is typically inaccessible outside your private network.
- **Teleport Proxy Service:** The cluster frontend, which handles user requests,
  forwards user credentials to the Auth Service, and communicates with Teleport
  instances that enable access to specific resources in your infrastructure.
- **Teleport Application Service:** Enables secure access to web applications in
  private networks. In this tutorial, we will use Teleport to access a simple
  web service.
- **Teleport SSH Service:** An SSH server implementation that takes advantage of
  Teleport's short-lived certificates, sophisticated RBAC, session recording,
  and other features.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux machine with only port `443` open to ingress traffic. You must be able
  to install and run software on the machine. Either configure access to your
  machine via SSH for the initial setup (and open an SSH port in addition port
  `443`) or enter the commands in this guide into an Amazon EC2
  [user data script](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html),
  Google Compute Engine
  [startup script](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/startup-scripts),
  or similar.
- A two-factor authenticator app such as [Authy](https://authy.com/download/), [Google Authenticator](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/), or [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator)
- `python3` installed on your Linux machine. We will use this to run a simple
  HTTP file server, so you can use another HTTP server if you have one
  installed.

You must also have one of the following:
- A registered domain name.
- An authoritative DNS nameserver managed by your organization, plus an existing
  certificate authority. If using this approach, ensure that your browser is
  configured to use your organization's nameserver.

<Admonition title="Local-only setups" type="tip">

If you would like to try out Teleport on your local machine—e.g., you do not
have access to DNS resources or internal public key infrastructure—we recommend
following our [Docker Compose guide](../try-out-teleport/docker-compose.mdx).

</Admonition>

## Step 1/6. Configure DNS

Teleport uses TLS to provide secure access to its Proxy Service and Auth
Service, and this requires a domain name that clients can use to verify
Teleport's certificate.

(!docs/pages/includes/dns.mdx!)

## Step 2/6. Run a simple web service

Run the following commands to create a directory on your Linux machine
called `demo-app` and add a simple HTML file to serve to clients:

```code
$ mkdir demo-app
$ cat<<EOF>>demo-app/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html><head><title>Welcome!</title><head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to your Teleport cluster!</h1>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

Run a simple HTTP service on port 9000 that returns your welcome page:

```code
$ nohup python3 -m http.server 9000 --directory demo-app &
```

Since port 9000 is not open on your Linux host, there is currently no way to
access the web service from your local machine. We will configure Teleport to
enable you to access the web service securely.

## Step 3/6. Set up Teleport on your Linux host

### Install Teleport

Run the appropriate commands for your environment to install the Teleport binary
on your Linux host:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

<Details title="Don't see your system here?" opened={false}>

Take a look at the [Installation Guide](../installation.mdx) for more options.

</Details>

### Configure Teleport

Generate a configuration file for Teleport using the `teleport configure` command.
This command requires information about a TLS certificate and private key.

(!docs/pages/includes/tls-certificate-setup.mdx!)

Next, configure Teleport to provide secure access to your web service. Edit your
Teleport configuration file (`/etc/teleport.yaml`) to include the following,
replacing `teleport.example.com` with the domain name of your Teleport cluster.

```yaml
app_service:
    enabled: yes
    apps:
    - name: "demo"
      uri: "http://localhost:9000"
      public_addr: "demo.teleport.example.com"
```

### Start Teleport

On your Linux machine, run the necessary commands to start the `teleport` daemon
(this depends on how you installed Teleport earlier).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Package manager RPM/DEB">

    ```code
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Source or custom install">
  Create a systemd unit file using the `teleport install systemd` command and the unit file path you'd
  like to use for your configuration. We recommend the path `/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service` for most use cases:

    ```code
    $ sudo teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
    ```
  Enable and start the new `teleport` daemon:

    ```code
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport && sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can access Teleport's Web UI via HTTPS at the domain you created earlier
(e.g., `https://teleport.example.com`). You should see a welcome screen similar
to the following:

![Teleport Welcome Screen](../../img/quickstart/welcome.png)

## Step 4/6. Create a Teleport user and set up two-factor authentication

In this step, we'll create a new Teleport user, `teleport-admin`, which is
allowed to log into SSH hosts as any of the principals `root`, `ubuntu`, or
`ec2-user`.

On your Linux machine, run the following command:

```code
# tctl is an administrative tool that is used to configure Teleport's auth service.
$ sudo tctl users add teleport-admin --roles=editor,access --logins=root,ubuntu,ec2-user
```

The command prints a message similar to the following:

```text
User "teleport-admin" has been created but requires a password. Share this URL with the user to complete user setup, link is valid for 1h:
https://teleport.example.com:443/web/invite/123abc456def789ghi123abc456def78

NOTE: Make sure teleport.example.com:443 points at a Teleport proxy which users can access.
```

Visit the provided URL in order to create your Teleport user.

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="OS User Mappings"
>

  The users that you specify in the `logins` flag (e.g., `root`, `ubuntu` and
  `ec2-user` in our examples) must exist on your Linux machine. Otherwise, you
  will get authentication errors later in this tutorial.

  If a user does not already exist, you can create it with `adduser <login>` or 
  use [Host user creation](../server-access/guides/host-user-creation.mdx)
  
  If you do not have the permission to create new users on the Linux host, run
  `tctl users add teleport $(whoami)` to explicitly allow Teleport to
  authenticate as the user that you have currently logged in as.

</Admonition>

Teleport enforces the use of two-factor authentication by default. It supports
one-time passwords (OTP) and second-factor authenticators (WebAuthn). In this
guide, you will need to enroll an OTP authenticator application using the QR
code on the Teleport welcome screen.

## Step 5/6. Log in using tsh

`tsh` is our client tool. It helps you log in to Teleport clusters and obtain
short-lived credentials. It can also be used to list resources registered with
Teleport, such as servers, applications, and Kubernetes clusters.

Install `tsh` on your local machine:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Mac">
    [Download the MacOS .pkg installer](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download?os=mac) (`tsh` client only, signed) and double-click to run it.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Mac - Homebrew">
    ```code
    $ brew install teleport
    ```

    <Admonition type="note">
      The Teleport package in Homebrew is not maintained by Teleport and we can't
      guarantee its reliability or security. We recommend the use of our [own Teleport packages](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download?os=mac).

      If you choose to use Homebrew, you must verify that the versions of `tsh` and
      `tctl` are compatible with the versions you run server-side. Homebrew usually
      ships the latest release of Teleport, which may be incompatible with older
      versions. See our [compatibility policy](../management/operations/upgrading.mdx#component-compatibility) for details.
    </Admonition>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Windows - Powershell">
    ```code
    $ curl -O teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip
    # Unzip the archive and move `tsh.exe` to your %PATH%
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux">
    For more options (including RPM/DEB packages and downloads for i386/ARM/ARM64) please see our [installation page](../installation.mdx).

    ```code
    $ curl -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzf teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    $ cd teleport
    $ sudo ./install
    # Teleport binaries have been copied to /usr/local/bin
    # To configure the systemd service for Teleport take a look at examples/systemd/README.mdx
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Log in to receive short-lived certificates from Teleport:

```code
# Replace teleport.example.com with your Teleport cluster's public address as configured above.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=teleport-admin
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       teleport-admin
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, editor
  Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-04-26 03:04:46 -0400 EDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

## Step 6/6. Access resources

Congrats! You've completed setting up Teleport and signed in to your cluster.
Now you can use Teleport to quickly access resources.

### Visit your demo website

Now that you have logged in to Teleport, you can see the demo website you
started earlier. Visit `https://demo.teleport.example.com`, replacing
`teleport.example.com` with the domain name of your Teleport cluster.

You can use the Teleport Application Service to configure access to any web
application in your private network, including HTTP management endpoints for
popular infrastructure technologies.

### SSH into your Node

You also configured the Teleport SSH Service, meaning that you can easily access
your Linux machine after logging in to Teleport.

See the logins you can use to access a Node:

```code
$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       teleport-admin
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, editor
  Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-04-26 04:55:59 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h38m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

List all SSH servers connected to Teleport:

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name        Address        Labels
---------------- -------------- -------------------------------------
mynode 127.0.0.1:3022 env=example,hostname=mynode
```

SSH into `mynode` as `root`:

```code
$ tsh ssh root@mynode
```
