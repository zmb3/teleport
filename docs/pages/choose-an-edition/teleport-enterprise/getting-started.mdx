title: Get Started with Teleport Enterprise
description: Learn how to deploy your first Teleport Enterprise cluster.
---

This guide shows you how to get up and running with Teleport Enterprise.

You will be deploying three Teleport services on a single host:

- The **Auth Service** stores user accounts and your cluster configuration. It
  provides authentication and authorization for every Teleport service and every
  user in your cluster.

- The **Proxy Service** routes client connection requests to the appropriate
  Teleport services and serves the Teleport Web UI, which you can use to access
  resources or manage the cluster.

- The **SSH Service**  is an SSH server implementation that provides seamless
  access to Linux hosts in your cluster. 

  SSH Service instances are called **Teleport Nodes**. When a Teleport Node
  receives a connection request, the request is authenticated through the
  cluster's Auth Service.

  Other Teleport services provide access to remote desktops, Kubernetes
  clusters, applications, and databases.

You will install the `teleport` binary, which runs runs all three of these
services by default.

You will also use the following client tools:

| Tool | Description |
| - | - |
| `tctl` | Cluster administration tool used to perform tasks such as inviting Nodes to a cluster and managing user accounts. |
| `tsh` | Allows users to authenticate and access resources via their local machine. |
| Web UI | You can use the Teleport Web UI to access resources in your cluster by navigating to the public address of your Teleport Proxy Service in your browser. |

(!docs/pages/includes//cloud/call-to-action.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

- A Teleport Enterprise account. If you do not have one, use our [signup
  form](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise/) to schedule a demo with the
  Teleport Sales Team.
- A Linux machine with only port `443` open to ingress traffic. You must be able
  to install and run software on the machine. Either configure access to your
  machine via SSH for the initial setup (and open an SSH port in addition port
  `443`) or enter the commands in this guide into an Amazon EC2
  [user data script](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html),
  Google Compute Engine
  [startup script](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/startup-scripts),
  or similar.
- A two-factor authenticator app such as [Authy](https://authy.com/download/),
  [Google Authenticator](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/), or [Microsoft
  Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator).
- `python3` installed on your Linux machine. We will use this to run a simple
  HTTP file server, so you can use another HTTP server if you have one
  installed.

You must also have one of the following:
- A registered domain name.
- An authoritative DNS nameserver managed by your organization, plus some means
  of obtaining a TLS certificate and private key for your Teleport deployment.
  If using this approach, ensure that your browser is configured to use your
  organization's nameserver.

## Step 1/5. Create DNS records

Teleport uses TLS to provide secure access to its Proxy Service and Auth
Service, and this requires a domain name that clients can use to verify
Teleport's certificate.

(!docs/pages/includes/dns.mdx!)

## Step 2/5. Run a simple web service

Create a directory on your Linux machine called `demo-app` and run the following
command:

```code
$ cat<<EOF>>demo-app/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html><head><title>Welcome!</title><head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to your Teleport cluster!</h1>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

Run a simple HTTP service on port 9000 that returns your welcome page:

```code
$ nohup python3 -m http.server 9000 --directory demo-app &
```

Since port 9000 is not open on your Linux host, there is currently no way to
access the web service from your local machine. We will configure Teleport to
enable you to access the web service securely.

## Step 3/5. Set up Teleport

### Install the `teleport` binary

On the host where you will run your Teleport services, run the following
commands to install the `teleport` binary:

<Details title="Need FedRAMP/FIPs compliance?">

For FedRAMP/FIPS-compliant installations of Teleport Enterprise, package URLs
will be slightly different:

```code
$ curl https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-fips-bin.tar.gz.sha256
# <checksum> <filename>
$ curl -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-fips-bin.tar.gz
$ shasum -a 256 teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-fips-bin.tar.gz
# Verify that the checksums match
$ tar -xzf teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-fips-bin.tar.gz
$ cd teleport-ent
$ sudo ./install
```

</Details>

```code
$ curl https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz.sha256
# <checksum> <filename>
$ curl -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
$ shasum -a 256 teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
# Verify that the checksums match
$ tar -xzf teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
$ cd teleport-ent
$ sudo ./install
```

### Configure Teleport

Generate a configuration file for Teleport using the `teleport configure` command.
This command requires information about a TLS certificate and private key.

If you are exposing your Teleport host to the internet, we recommend using Let's
Encrypt to receive your key and certificate automatically. For private networks
or custom deployments, use your own private key and certificate.

(!docs/pages/includes/tls-certificate-setup.mdx!)

Next, configure Teleport to provide secure access to your web service. Edit your
Teleport configuration file (`/etc/teleport.yaml`) to include the following,
replacing `teleport.example.com` with the domain name of your Teleport cluster.

```yaml
app_service:
    enabled: yes
    apps:
    - name: "demo"
      uri: "http://localhost:9000"
      public_addr: "demo.teleport.example.com"
```

### Obtain your license file

The `teleport` binary reads a local license file to authenticate your Teleport
Enterprise account.

To obtain your license file, visit the [Teleport customer
dashboard](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login) and log in. Click
"DOWNLOAD LICENSE KEY". You will see your current Teleport Enterprise account
permissions and the option to download your license file:

![License File modal](../../../img/enterprise/license.png)

Save your license file on the host where you will install Teleport at the path,
`/var/lib/teleport/license.pem`.

### Start Teleport 

On the host where you are running Teleport, generate a systemd unit file for
Teleport and save it in `/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service`:

```code
$ sudo teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
```

Enable the Teleport service and start Teleport in the background:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport
$ sudo systemctl start teleport
```

Confirm that the `teleport` service has started: 

```
$ sudo systemctl status teleport
```

### Get information about your Teleport deployment

You can review the logs of the Teleport service with the following command:

```code
$ journalctl -fu teleport
```
Run the following command to review the ports that Teleport is
listening on:

```code
$ sudo netstat -lptne
```

The output should look something like this:

```code
$ sudo netstat -lptne | grep teleport
tcp6       0      0 :::443                  :::*                    LISTEN
0          168760     29504/teleport    
tcp6       0      0 :::3022                 :::*                    LISTEN
0          167812     29504/teleport    
tcp6       0      0 :::3025                 :::*                    LISTEN
0          168741     29504/teleport
```

## Step 4/5. Add a local user

### Create a user

Every user in a Teleport cluster must be assigned at least one role. By default,
Teleport comes with several pre-configured roles known as **presets**:

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|`access`| Can access resources in your infrastructure, such as Teleport Nodes, applications, and Kubernetes clusters|
|`auditor`|Can view audit logs and session recordings.|
|`editor`| Can modify cluster configuration.|

You can see the full configurations for these roles by executing the following
command on the host running Teleport:

```code
$ sudo tctl get roles
```

On the host where you are running Teleport, create a Teleport user called
`myuser` with the `access` role and the `ubuntu` login. This user can log in to
any host in your infrastructure as `ubuntu` (choose a login that matches a user
account on your Linux host):

```code
$ sudo tctl users add --roles=access --logins=ubuntu myuser

Signup token has been created and is valid for 1 hours. Share this URL with the user:
https://auth.example.com:3080/web/newuser/22e3acb6a0c2cde22f13bdc879ff9d2a
```

Navigate to the link displayed in your terminal, pick a password, and configure
second factor authentication.

### Log in as your new user

`tsh` is our client tool. It helps you log in to Teleport clusters and obtain
short-lived credentials. It can also be used to list resources registered with
Teleport, such as servers, applications, and Kubernetes clusters.

Install `tsh` on your local machine:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="macOS">

Run the following commands to download and run the Teleport installer:

  ```code
  $ curl -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-ent-(=teleport.version=).pkg
  # Installs on Macintosh HD
  $ sudo installer -pkg teleport-ent-(=teleport.version=).pkg -target / 
  # Password:
  # installer: Package name is teleport-ent-(=teleport.version=)
  # installer: Upgrading at base path /
  # installer: The upgrade was successful.
  $ which teleport
  # /usr/local/bin/teleport
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux">

Run the following commands to install Teleport binaries on your client system,
including `tsh`:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows PowerShell">

Most `tsh` features are supported for Windows 10 1607+. The `tsh ssh` command
can be run under `cmd.exe`, PowerShell, and Windows Terminal.

To install `tsh` on Windows, run the following commands in PowerShell:

  ```code
  # Get the expected checksum for the Windows tsh package
  $ $Resp = Invoke-WebRequest https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip.sha256
  # PowerShell will return the binary representation of the response content
  # by default, so you need to convert it to a string
  $ [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.getstring($Resp.Content)
  # <checksum> <filename>
  $ curl -O teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip
  $ certUtil -hashfile teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip SHA256
  # SHA256 hash of teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip:
  # <checksum>
  # CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
  ```

  After you have verified that the checksums match, you can extract the archive.
  The executable will be available at
  `teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin\teleport\tsh.exe`.

  ```code
  $ Expand-Archive teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin.zip
  $ cd teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-windows-amd64-bin\teleport
  $ .\tsh.exe version
  Teleport v(=teleport.version=) git:v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
  ```

  Make sure to move `tsh.exe` into your PATH.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Use `tsh` to log in to your Teleport cluster as `myuser`, replacing
`auth.example.com` with the domain name you configured earlier:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=auth.example.com login --user=myuser
```

Note that you can omit the `--user` flag if the `$USER` environment variable
is equal to your Teleport username.  

If successful, the `tsh login` command will retrieve a user certificate for
`myuser` and store it in the `~/.tsh/keys/<proxy>` directory.

With a certificate in place, `myuser` can now interact with the Teleport cluster.

## Step 5/5. Access resources

You have now completed setting up Teleport and signed in to your cluster.  Now
you can use Teleport to quickly access resources.

### Visit your demo website

Now that you have logged in to Teleport, you can see the demo website you
started earlier. Visit `https://demo.teleport.example.com`, replacing
`teleport.example.com` with the domain name of your Teleport cluster. You can
only visit the website if you have authenticated with your cluster.

You can use the Teleport Application Service to configure access to any web
application in your private network, including HTTP management endpoints for
popular infrastructure technologies.

### SSH into your Node

You also configured the Teleport SSH Service, meaning that you can easily access
your Linux machine after logging in to Teleport.

See the logins you can use to access a Node:

```code
$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       teleport-admin
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, editor
  Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-04-26 04:55:59 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h38m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

List all SSH servers connected to Teleport:

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name        Address        Labels                                
---------------- -------------- ------------------------------------- 
mynode 127.0.0.1:3022 env=example,hostname=mynode
```

<Details title="tsh not showing Nodes?" opened={false}>

(!docs/pages/includes/node-logins.mdx!)

</Details>

SSH into your Node, replacing `mynode` with one of the Nodes listed by
the `tsh ls` command and `ubuntu` with the login on your Linux host that you
configured `myuser` to access:

```code
$ tsh ssh ubuntu@mynode
```

## Next steps

### Deploy on Kubernetes

This guide shows you how to install Teleport Enterprise on a virtual machine. If
you are using a Kubernetes-based environment, see our [Getting Started
Guide](../../deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/kubernetes-cluster.mdx) for how to
deploy Teleport on Kubernetes.

### Configure RBAC

The preset `access` role we assigned to a user in this guide is probably too
permissive for your environment. Read our guide to [configuring Teleport
roles](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx) to set up more granular
access controls.

### Configure SSO

In this guide, we created a **local user** stored on the Teleport Auth Service.
For on and offboarding users at scale, you should use one of Teleport's Single
Sign-On integrations.

Take a look at our [Single Sign-On](../../access-controls/sso.mdx) guide to
learn the basics of integrating Teleport with SSO providers.

You can configure any SAML- or OIDC-compliant identity provider to enable SSO
for Teleport. There are Teleport Enterprise customers who are using Oracle IDM,
SailPoint, and others.

### Configure Access Requests

With Teleport Access Requests you can provide your users limited access to
resources by default. Your users can then access elevated privileges on a
temporary basis, minimizing the risk that an attacker will compromise an admin
account.

[Read our guide](../../access-controls/access-requests.mdx) to setting up Access
Requests.

You can then take advantage of Teleport's [Access Request
plugins](../../access-controls/access-request-plugins/index.mdx) so users can
request and review Access Requests using your existing communication workflows.

## Troubleshooting

If Teleport services do not start, take a look at the `teleport` service's logs:

```code
$ sudo journalctl -fu teleport
```

Usually the error will be reported there. Common reasons for failure are:

- Network issues: port `443` is closed via iptables or occupied by another
  process.
- Disk issues: Teleport fails to create `/var/lib/teleport` because the volume
  is read-only or not accessible.
