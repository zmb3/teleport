This guide explains the use of a license file with Teleport Enterprise.

Commercial self-hosted Teleport subscriptions require a valid license. The
license file can be downloaded from the [Teleport Customer
Portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login). When downloading the
file, the products you are licensed to use will be listed in the browser.

The Teleport license file contains an X.509 certificate and the corresponding
private key in PEM format. Place the downloaded file on your Teleport Auth
Servers and set the `license_file` configuration parameter of your
`teleport.yaml` to point to the file location:

```yaml
auth_service:
    license_file: /var/lib/teleport/license.pem
```

The `license_file` path can be either absolute or relative to the configured
`data_dir`. If the license file path is not set, Teleport will look for the
`license.pem` file in the configured `data_dir`.

Only Auth Servers require the license. Proxies and Nodes that do not also run the Auth Service do not need the license.  
    
Attempts to use unlicensed products will result in an error message and users will be unable to use those products. For example, if you attempt to use Database Access without it being included in the license, you will get a message similar to:
```code
this Teleport cluster is not licensed for database access, please contact the cluster administrator
```

## License updates and renewals

If your license is updated for features and/or renewals an updated license file is required.  Download the updated license file
from the [Teleport Customer
Portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login) and reinstall to all Teleport Auth Service instances.
After restarting the Teleport Auth Service, any changes to the license will take effect.
