## Security

We have designed the Teleport Cloud environment to be secure. We work with independent
security auditors on a regular basis to identify and correct any gaps, while also
continuing to iterate on improvements to fortify the platform for the most strict of
compliance use-cases.

## Compliance

(!docs/pages/includes/soc2.mdx!)

## Managed Teleport Settings

SSH sessions are recorded [on nodes](../../architecture/nodes.mdx).
Teleport Cloud Proxy does not terminate SSH sessions when using OpenSSH and `tsh` sessions.
The Cloud Proxy terminates TLS for Application, Database, and Kubernetes sessions.

## Data retention
Data retention cannot currently be configured by customers. All Teleport Cloud
customers have audit logs retained in DynamoDB for 1 year, cluster configuration
retained in DynamoDB indefinitely, and session recordings retained in S3 indefinitely.
When data retention policies are introduced, customers will be contacted and
able to specify their preferred data retention schedules.

Customers whose subscriptions lapse will have all session recordings, audit logs, and
cluster state deleted between 7 and 30 days after the lapse.

## High Availability

### Auth Service
The Teleport [auth service](https://goteleport.com/docs/architecture/authentication/) is deployed within the AWS us-west-2 region in 4 availability zones, and can tolerate a single zone failure. AWS guarantees [99.99%](https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/) of monthly uptime.

### Proxies
The Teleport [proxy service](https://goteleport.com/docs/architecture/proxy/) can be deployed to multiple AWS regions around the world for low-latency access to distributed infrastructure.

- us-west-2 (default)
- us-east-1
- eu-central-1
- ap-south-1
- ap-southeast-1
- sa-east-1

The multi-region option is currently opt-in by default. Once you have an account, please reach out to your account manager, customer success engineer, or support@goteleport.com. A future update will expand the region availability and make all regions available by default.

## Releases

Teleport Cloud only serves the latest stable release of the Teleport software
for its customers.

Teleport Cloud team upgrades the service with patch releases weekly and major
releases quarterly. The team waits for the first minor release before a major
upgrade. For example, the team will deploy (=cloud.major_version=).1.0
instead of (=cloud.major_version=).0.0. The first minor release happens 3-4
weeks after a first major release.

Patch releases are fully backward compatible and require no actions by the
customer.

Major releases do require customers to upgrade all instances of Teleport they
are running within 3 months of the upgrade. Failure to upgrade Teleport instances to the
latest major release during this window may lead to compatibility issues with
Teleport Cloud and a loss of access to your infrastructure.

## Service Level Agreement

Teleport Cloud commits to an SLA of (=cloud.sla.monthly_percentage=) of monthly uptime,
a maximum of (=cloud.sla.monthly_downtime=) of downtime per month. As we continue to invest in the
cloud product and infrastructure, the SLA will be increased.
